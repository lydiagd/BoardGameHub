# BoardGameHub

### **1. Goal of Application:**
  I will be creating an Online Board Game Hub where users can see a list of free, playable games online (board game, computer game, escape rooms, etc), and their respective links.   Inspiration and many of my database entries will come from the Quarantine Games Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/10iOD7Wy_YU4NmkPU7ZH7YTrq11qJAANjZZ0PAotKhR8/mobilebasic# 

### **2. Primary Audience:**
  The audience targets those who are in quarantine right now but still want to play a game with friends! As a big board gamer myself, having access to online games really helped     me cope while in quarantine. This Hub aims to be more interactive with the individual person by having their favorite games saved and them easily adding entries to the hub. They   can also add their own favorite games to the hub too!

### **3. Create, Read, Update, Delete Operations:**
  As mentioned above, I'd like the users to be able to see all the entries in the hub whether or not they have an account. If the user has an account, they should be able to         create new entries to add to the hub's list, as well as save their favorite entries to keep track of on their own account page. They should be able to both add and delete from     their favorites list. If possible, I can also try to make a list of entries that user added to the hub, where that user can update these entries when needed.

### **4. Additional Feature:**
  The additional feature I'd like to implement would be having users log in to their account, which will display a list of favorite games that person wanted to save. This favorite   system will show the timestamp of the game's save date, as well as the entry information of that game. The goal is for these games to be easily accessible to the player without   having to go find it all over again.
